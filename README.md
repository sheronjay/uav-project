# uav-project
This project aims to develop an intelligent UAV system capable of autonomously detecting, tracking, and landing on a moving platform. Once successfully landed, the drone will initiate a self-charging process without human intervention. The goal is to simulate a fully autonomous drone docking workflow, combining real-time object tracking, control systems, and automated power management.
